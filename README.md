This simple project is to enable multiple client and single server communication using TCP protocol

1. this includes multithreading 
2. socket programming

Learning
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
1. Here system.in is keyboard. gives bytes as input. Byte stream as input.
2. InputStreamReader will convert bytes to char using encoding format, we can set it.
3. BufferedReader is especially usefull when u want to read multiline or in simple words strings instead of char


questions
1. how concurrentHashMap runs internally
2. why even If i close the server, the client are still running
